This code aims to solve Task 3 - BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION. To solve this problem, we have mostly used Python and the sklearn library. 

To pass the baseline and get the best result possible, we have followed the quantitative details put in the task description. 
Firstly, we have implemented the code to complete the class BO_algo init method by initializing the necessary objective and constraint models with GaussianProcessRegressor. We have then implemented the methods next_recommendation and acquisition_function. Moreover, an important part of this task was to complete the add_data_point method. It was necessary in this method to make sure that we correctly handle the shapes of our x, z and c arrays for fitting the objective and constraint models. Finally, we completed the get_solution method to return the x_opt that minimizes the objective model but respect as well the constraint. 

Our best result led to a score of 0.1574 on the leaderboard.
