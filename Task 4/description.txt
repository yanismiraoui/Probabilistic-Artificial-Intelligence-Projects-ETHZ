This code aims to solve Task 4 - REINFORCEMENT LEARNING. To solve this problem, we have mostly used Python and the PyTorch library. 

To pass the baseline and get the best result possible, we have followed the details put in the task description and the hints put as comments in the code. 
Firstly, we have implemented the code to complete the class MLPActorCritic's step method by sampling an action from the policy and then computing the corresponding value function and log-probability. We have then implemented the methods pi_update and v_update of the Agent class. We have tried different loss functions before finding the right one, i.e. the one that performs well. 
Moreover, we also completed the get method in order to normalize the values obtained earlier. Finally, an important part of this task was to implement the computation of phi in the end_traj method. We acheived it by calling the discount_cumsum() function.

Our best result led to a score of 222.99 on the leaderboard.
