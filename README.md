# Projects for the Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence course at ETH Zürich 📚

Please note that the notebooks were used as exploratory tools 🔍. The *solution.py* files were designed to pass the baselines for the Probabilistic Artficial Intelligence Projects during the Autumn semester 2021. 🍂 

### ✅ Task 1 - GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION ⚙️: To solve this problem, we have mostly used Python and the sklearn library. 

### ✅ Task 2 - BAYESIAN NEURAL NETS 🧠: To solve this problem, we have mostly used Python and the PyTorch library.

### ✅ Task 3 - BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION 🌠: To solve this problem, we have mostly used Python and the sklearn library. 

### ✅ Task 4 - REINFORCEMENT LEARNING 🧮: To solve this problem, we have mostly used Python and the PyTorch library.
